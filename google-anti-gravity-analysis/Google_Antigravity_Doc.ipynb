    "# Google Antigravity — Simple Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick intro:**  \n",
    "Google Antigravity is an agent-first development platform/IDE that integrates AI agents to assist with planning, coding, testing, and browser-in-the-loop verification. This notebook contains a concise, easy-to-follow documentation targeted at full‑stack / MERN / data/dev workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is Antigravity?\n",
    "- An \"agent-first\" IDE by Google that lets AI agents plan and execute development tasks across editor, terminal, and browser.\n",
    "- Agents can scaffold features, run tests, take browser screenshots, and produce artifacts for verification.\n",
    "- Supports models like Gemini 3 Pro and others; available in a public preview for individual developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Key Features & Why They Matter\n",
    "- **Agent Manager (Mission Control):** spawn/manage multiple agents across workspaces.\n",
    "- **Editor View + Agent Sidebar:** familiar coding UI augmented with agent features and suggestions.\n",
    "- **Integrated Browser & Terminal:** agents can run commands and test UIs in a real browser.\n",
    "- **Artifacts for Trust:** agents produce plans, screenshots, and recordings you can review.\n",
    "- **Task-level prompting:** ask agents to build features end-to-end instead of micromanaging lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Use-Cases (Tailored)\n",
    "- **MERN App Feature:** scaffold Express API + React component + Mongo queries end-to-end.\n",
    "- **Data Pipeline Automation:** connect sources, run ETL, and generate dashboards.\n",
    "- **Refactor & Test Legacy Codebase:** agents analyze, refactor, and write tests.\n",
    "- **UX Iteration:** browser-driven UI testing, screenshots, and visual feedback loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Getting Started (Step-by-step)\n",
    "1. **Download & Install** from `antigravity.google/download` — choose OS (Windows/macOS/Linux).\n",
    "2. **Initial config:** sign in with Google account, pick model (Gemini 3 Pro), set terminal/agent policies.\n",
    "3. **Explore the UI:** Editor view, Agent Manager, Artifacts panel, integrated Terminal & Browser.\n",
    "4. **Create a first task:** e.g., _\"Create a simple React component that fetches from an API and displays a table.\"_\n",
    "5. **Link tasks for full-stack flows:** spawn backend + frontend tasks and connect them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Best Practices & Pitfalls\n",
    "**Do:**\n",
    "- Write clear prompts with goals and acceptance criteria.\n",
    "- Use planning mode for complex tasks and fast mode for quick tweaks.\n",
    "- Always review artifacts for non-trivial changes.\n",
    "- Keep separate workspaces for unrelated tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Watch out:**\n",
    "- Agents can produce messy boilerplate—review and clean up.\n",
    "- Don't fully outsource architecture decisions.\n",
    "- Validate tests and performance yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. How This Fits You\n",
    "- **Full-stack (MERN):** speed up scaffolding, testing, and frontend verification.\n",
    "- **Data/Analytics:** automate ETL, dashboards, and data visualizations.\n",
    "- **Business Analyst angle:** define the \"what\" and agents execute the \"how\"; you verify outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Quick Prompt Template (MERN)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Task: Build a feature end-to-end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal:\n",
    "- Add an analytics endpoint to the Express backend that returns last 7 days of user signups from MongoDB.\n",
    "- Create a React component at /dashboard that fetches this endpoint and displays a line chart and a data table.\n",
    "- Include basic responsive styles and unit tests for the backend endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acceptance Criteria:\n",
    "- The endpoint returns JSON { date: 'YYYY-MM-DD', signups: <number> } for 7 days.\n",
    "- React component renders chart and table and handles loading/error states.\n",
    "- Unit tests cover the endpoint (happy & error paths).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "- Use Mongoose for Mongo models.\n",
    "- Use Chart.js or Recharts for the frontend chart.\n",
    "- Keep components functional and use hooks.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Quick Checklist to Review Artifacts\n",
    "- [ ] Does the artifact include a clear plan or task list?\n",
    "- [ ] Are tests included and passing locally?\n",
    "- [ ] Are screenshots/browser recordings attached for UI changes?\n",
    "- [ ] Is there any unnecessary boilerplate or insecure config?\n",
    "- [ ] Is the prompt/goal reflected accurately in the delivered code?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you want, I can also add code snippets or a sample tiny MERN repo scaffold in the notebook — tell me and I’ll drop it in here.*\n"
